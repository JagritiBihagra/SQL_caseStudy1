# SQL Case Study: Sales & Marketing Insights

This repository contains a SQL-based case study derived from an Intellipaat SQL training exercise. The goal is to analyze customer, product, and geographic data using SQL queries to generate insights for business decisions such as identifying top-selling products, assessing profit margins, and understanding regional performance.

## Problem Statement

As a Database Administrator, you are tasked with analyzing sample customer data to answer business-critical questions regarding sales, marketing spend, and profit distribution across different states and product types.

## Dataset Description

1. **Fact Table (`fact.xlsx`)**
   - Contains transactional data (4200 rows)
   - Key fields: `Date`, `ProductID`, `Sales`, `Profit`, `COGS`, `Total Expenses`, `Marketing`, `Inventory`, `Budget Profit`, etc.

2. **Product Table (`Product.xlsx`)**
   - Product metadata (13 rows)
   - Fields: `ProductID`, `Product`, `Product Type`, `Type`

3. **Location Table (`location..xlsx`)**
   - Geographic info (156 rows)
   - Fields: `Area Code`, `State`, `Market`, `Market Size`

4. **SQL Script (`CaseStudy1.sql`)**
   - Contains 29 SQL queries solving tasks such as:
     - Aggregating sales by state
     - Computing marketing spend
     - Identifying top/bottom performing products
     - Creating stored procedures and functions
     - Handling transactions and conditionals

## Tasks Performed

The queries in `CaseStudy1.sql` address:
- Descriptive statistics (counts, sums, averages)
- Joins across fact, product, and location tables
- Conditional logic (e.g., profits vs. loss)
- Advanced SQL (stored procedures, UDFs, DENSE_RANK, roll-up, etc.)
- Data filtering and transformation
- ASCII functions and transaction rollback

## Sample SQL Query
Display total profit generated by Colorado state
SELECT SUM(f.profit) AS total_profit
FROM fact f
JOIN Location l ON f.[Area Code] = l.[Area Code]
WHERE l.State = 'Colorado';


## Usage
Import the Excel files into SQL Server or your preferred RDBMS.

Run CaseStudy1.sql to explore data insights.

Modify queries to reflect new business questions or KPIs.

## Reference
This case study is based on a SQL Certification Training Case Study by Intellipaat.

## Tools Required
SQL Server / MySQL / PostgreSQL
